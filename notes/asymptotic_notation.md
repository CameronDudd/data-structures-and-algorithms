## Asymptotic Notation
### Big Theta (Θ)
 - Only one case in terms of runtime

### Big Omega (Ω)
 - Best case runtime

### Big O (O)
 - Worse case runtime

## Common Runtimes
#### Θ(1) [constant]
 - Program will always do the same thing regardless of input
#### Θ(log N) [logarithmic]
 - Seen in search algorithms
#### Θ(N) [linear]
 - Iterating through a dataset
#### Θ(N * log N)
 - Seen in sorting algorithms
#### Θ(N ^ 2) [quadratic]
 - Seen when having to search through a two-dimensional dataset
#### Θ(2 ^ N) [exponential]
 - Seen in recursive algorithms
#### Θ(N!) [factorial]
 - Seen when you have to find all of the different permutations of something
